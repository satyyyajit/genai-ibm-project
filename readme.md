# üéì College Feedback Classifier

A Generative AI-based project that automatically classifies student feedback into categories such as Academics, Facilities, Administration, and Student Life using the FLAN-T5 base model and prompt engineering techniques.

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the analysis of open-ended student feedback collected by educational institutions. It uses few-shot prompting with a pre-trained FLAN-T5 model to predict the primary theme of each feedback entry. The output is saved in structured formats (CSV/JSON), enabling easy visualization and data-driven decisions.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Info

The dataset is a synthetic collection of student feedback entries.  
It includes the following columns:

| Column Name      | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| feedback_id      | Unique identifier for each feedback         |
| feedback_text    | Open-ended feedback provided by students    |
| category         | Labeled category (Academics, Facilities, etc.) |
| department       | Associated department                       |
| rating           | Rating given (1‚Äì5)                          |
| semester         | Semester when the feedback was given        |
| student_type     | Type of student (Undergraduate, Transfer, etc.) |

## üéØ Objectives

- Classify open-ended student feedback into meaningful categories.
- Reduce manual effort in analyzing large volumes of qualitative feedback.
- Improve institutional response by surfacing common themes.
- Use prompt engineering with a language model to demonstrate few-shot classification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Steps)

1. Load the dataset from `college_feedbacks.csv`.
2. Use prompt engineering with few-shot examples.
3. Tokenize the prompt using `AutoTokenizer`.
4. Use `google/flan-t5-base` to classify the feedback.
5. Append predictions to the dataset.
6. Save the output to both CSV and JSON.
7. Visualize prediction performance using bar charts.
8. Evaluate accuracy with scikit-learn's classification report.
